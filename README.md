# Dotfiles

This repository is just a collection of dotfiles I deem are important either for me to restore or for people to take a gander at.
This repository uses stow as a dotfiles manager.
Got suggestions? [Make an issue](https://github.com/MonAaraj/dotfiles/issues).
For anything else, you can email me at mon.aaraj815\<at\>gmail.com

You can do whatever you want from what you find here, it's public without a license for a reason.
Don't use it for bad stuff though.
